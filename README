Camarilla is a restful server which allows clients to 
send requests and offers.

Its purpose is to support group formation among matching
or approximately matching requests and offers. 

The group formation can be done in one of the following ways: 
i) human choice but aided by the camarilla server providing an 
ordered set of highly ranked candidates,  and ii) 
by the server making the decision to match highly 
ranked candidates
